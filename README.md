# 🐾Pet Shop DApp Tutorial
Welcome to the Pet Shop Decentralized Application (DApp) built using Solidity and Truffle! This project is designed to help you learn the essentials of Ethereum DApp development through a fun and interactive pet shop example.

## 🌟 Overview
This tutorial guides you through the steps to build a fully functional Pet Shop DApp. You'll learn how to:
- Write smart contracts using Solidity
- Deploy contracts to the Ethereum blockchain
- Build a user interface to interact with your contracts
- Use Truffle for development, testing, and deployment

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Truffle
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)

# 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your Pet Shop DApp up and running:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Usman554433/pet-shop-tutorial.git
cd pet-shop-tutorial

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Compile the Smart Contracts
truffle compile

4. Deploy the Smart Contracts
Make sure Ganache is running, then deploy your contracts:
truffle migrate

5. Run the DApp
Start the local server to run your DApp:
npm run dev

## 📚 Tutorial Details
The tutorial covers the following key aspects:
- Smart Contracts: Learn to write and understand Solidity code.
- Truffle Suite: Use Truffle to manage and deploy your contracts.
- Front-End Integration: Connect your smart contracts to a web interface.
- Testing: Write and run tests to ensure your contracts work as expected.
